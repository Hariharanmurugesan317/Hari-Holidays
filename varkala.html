          Silappathigaram, Manimekalai, Purananuru and Akananuru. Mahavidwan R. Raghava Iyengar in the research
          monograph Araichi Katturaigal has given exhaustive references to Kollipavai from early Sangam literature,
          concluding that the image is in Kolli Hills. The region was ruled by Valvil Ori around 200 CE, who is praised
          as one of the seven great philanthropists of ancient Tamil Nadu. His valor and marksmanship are sung by
          several poets, and his exploits are a popular part of folklore. Ori is said to have killed a lion, bear, deer
          and a boar with a single arrow. The hills are said to be guarded by Kollipavai also called as "God's Gift", the local deity. According to
          legend, the sages chose Kolli hills when they were looking for a peaceful place to do their penance. However,
          the demons invaded the hills to disrupt the penance when the sages began their rituals. The sages prayed to
          Kollipavai, who according to the myth, chased away the demons with her enchanting smile. The Kollipavai hills
          is still worshipped by the people here and her smile is revered. The mountains have several mythological
          legends associated with them, and often come across as an eerie place in contemporary tales due to the
          unexplored and less traveled terrain. This mountain is full of herbs which retains health and vigour. E. D.
          Israel Oliver King of MS Swaminathan Research Foundation has documented over 250 sacred forests in Kolli Hills
